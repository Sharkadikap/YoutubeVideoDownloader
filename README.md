# YoutubeVideoDownloader
Download videos from youtube.<br>
I personally do this for long trips with my toddler to keep her entertained.
# How it works?
The python code will check and download pytube library if it isnt installed.<br>
A folder name "videos" will be created if it isnt there.<br>
A simple URL input from the user from a youtube video and it will be downlaoded into the videos folder.
